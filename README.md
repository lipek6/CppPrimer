This repo contains my progress while reading the "C++ Primer 5th edition".
It's just a way to record my own improvement on the C++ language and higher level programming in general.
I might create another repo to record a real project that might come from here, who knows.

The DaveLect folder is meant to hold all code that I will write following along this video: [Introduction to the C++ Programming Language](https://youtu.be/gSubXB3HUgc?si=368LtqQAPjZINA65).
I chave choosen this guy's lecture because he has a pretty complete course on game development from a low level perspective in C++ that I will follow a long after I get gud in C++.
